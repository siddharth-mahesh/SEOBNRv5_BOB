    "# Tutorial - Converting the Cartesian Phase Space Variables to their Spherical Polar Counterparts for the SEOBNR_v3_Sph routine\n",

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation of the gravitational wave approximant SEOBNRv3 is in Cartesian Coordinates. Additionally, the inputs for generating a waveform in the LIGO Algorithms Library (LALSuite) require the specification of the initial spin configurations of the binary black holes in Cartesian Coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next implementation of this approximant SEOBNRv3_Sph intends to perform all computations in a spherical polar phase space. Our problem is to take a set of 12 canonical variables: $x,y,z,p_x,p_y,p_z,S_{1x},S_{1y},S_{1z},S_{2x},S_{2y},S_{2z}$ to the set of canonical variables: $r,\\theta,\\phi,p_r,p_\\theta,p_\\phi,S_{1r},S_{1\\theta},S_{1\\phi},S_{2r},S_{2\\theta},S_{2\\phi}$. define them as such. \n",

    "\n",
    "Originally, there exists a coordinate system $(\\mathbf{e_x},\\mathbf{e_y},\\mathbf{e_z})$ (lebelled by subscript $i$) used to define the components of the position, momentum and spin vectors. When transitioning to the Spherical Coordinates, we work in the system of $\\mathbf{e_r},\\mathbf{e_\\theta},\\mathbf{e_\\phi}$ (labelled by subscript $a$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector must have its components rewritten in this basis through the transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{V} = V^i\\mathbf{e_i} = V^a\\mathbf{e_a}\\\\\n",
    "V^a = V^i\\mathbf{e_i}\\cdot\\mathbf{e_a}\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the vector transforms as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{V}^{(S)} = \\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{V}^{(C)}\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step : Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "The momenta transform according to a canonical transformation given by the generating function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = r\\cos\\phi\\sin\\theta p_x + r\\sin\\phi\\sin\\theta p_y + r\\cos\\theta p_z = r\\mathbf{e_r}\\cdot\\mathbf{p^{(C)}}\\\\\n",
    "p_a = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial q_a}\n",
