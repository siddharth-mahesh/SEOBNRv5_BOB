    "This notebook documents the symbolic partial derivative routine used to generate analytic derivatives of the [SEOBNRv3](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/lalsuite) Hamiltonian (documented [here](../Tutorial-SEOBNR_v3_Hamiltonian.ipynb)) and described in [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06346).  In general, this notebook takes as input a file of inter-dependent mathematical expressions (in SymPy syntax), a file listing the names of values within those expressions, and a file listing all variables with which to take partial derivatives of each expression.  The output is a text file containing the original expression and those for each partial derivative computation.  The intention is to perform CSE on these expressions to create efficient partial derivative code!"

    "We validate the output of this notebook against known LALSuite values of the Hamiltonian partial derivatives and the output of the `SEOBNR_Derivative_Routine` NRPy+ module.  We note that due to cancellations in the deriavtive terms, various versions of SymPy may result in relative errors that differ as much as an order of magnitude.  Furthermore, even changing the set of input pararameters can affect the relative error by as many as two orders of magnitude.  Therefore we look for agreement with LALSuite to at least 10 significant digits.\n",

    "When comparing the notebook output to that of the NRPy+ module, we compare term-by-term using SymPy to check that each right-hand side side is equivalent."
